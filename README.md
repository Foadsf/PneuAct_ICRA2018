# Description:
This Repository is indented to provide additional information for the article:

>  F. Sojoodi Farimani and S. Misra, "Introducing PneuAct: Parametrically-Designed MRI-Compatible Pneumatic Stepper Actuator," in Proc. IEEE Int. Conf. on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), vol.,Moon Year, pp.

presented at `The International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2018`. The main goal is to provide falsifiable experimental measurements required for a valid scientific publication. You may use these information only for scientific and academic purposes. It would be highly appreciated to cite to the main article using [this `.bib` file](https://github.com/Foadsf/PneuAct_ICRA2018/blob/master/ref.bib). If you are interested to use these informational for commercial use please contact the authors(s) via email: f.s.farimani@gmail.com.

For each Figure used in the article extra information and measurement data will be included in a separate folder:
* Fig4: raw MRI images plus python code for signal to noise ratio calculation
* Fig6: Experimental measurements in `.csv` format plus Mathematica code for interpolation and plotting
* Fig7: Experimental measurements in `.csv` format plus Mathematica code for interpolation and plotting
* Fig9: Experimental measurements in `.csv` format plus Mathematica code for interpolation and plotting
* Fig10: Experimental measurements in `.csv` format plus Mathematica code for interpolation and plotting

## todo
* Adding the correct citation to the `ref.bib` file and `README.MD`
